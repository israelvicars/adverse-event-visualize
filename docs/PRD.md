# Adverse Event Analyzer - Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## 1. Overview
### Product Name
Adverse Event Analyzer

### Purpose
A web application designed to help healthcare professionals analyze drug-related adverse event reports from the FDAâ€™s OpenFDA Adverse Events API. The tool provides actionable insights through search, filtering, metrics, and visualization, enabling users to understand key trends and risks associated with specific drugs.

### Objective
Build a functional prototype in 1 hour using Next.js that demonstrates interaction with a public API, delivering a minimum viable product (MVP) for a take-home interview.

### Target Audience
- Healthcare professionals (e.g., doctors, pharmacists).
- Interview evaluators assessing technical skills.

## 2. Scope
### In-Scope
- Search for adverse events by drug name.
- Filter adverse events by seriousness (e.g., death, hospitalization).
- Display key metrics (e.g., total reports, seriousness counts).
- Visualize adverse event trends over time (e.g., by year).

### Out-of-Scope (Due to 1-Hour Limit)
- Advanced filtering (e.g., pharmacological class, administration route).
- Integration with Drugs@FDA API.
- User authentication or persistent data storage.
- Extensive UI polish or accessibility features.

## 3. Requirements

### 3.1 Functional Requirements

- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Entering a drug name and clicking "Search" displays results.
  - Invalid or empty input shows a "No results" message.

#### FR2: Seriousness Filter
- **Description**: Users can filter adverse events by seriousness category.
- **Details**: 
  - Dropdown with options: "All", "Death", "Hospitalization".
  - Updates API query with `+seriousnessdeath:1` or `+seriousnesshospitalization:1`.
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Selecting a filter updates displayed results dynamically.
  - "All" option shows unfiltered results.

#### FR3: Key Metrics Display
- **Description**: Show summary statistics for adverse events of the searched drug.
- **Details**: 
  - Metrics: Total reports, count of deaths, count of hospitalizations.
  - Parsed from API response fields (`serious`, `seriousnessdeath`, `seriousnesshospitalization`).
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Metrics update correctly after search or filter change.
  - Displayed in a clear, readable format (e.g., cards or list).

#### FR4: Time Trend Visualization
- **Description**: Visualize adverse events over time for the searched drug.
- **Details**: 
  - Bar chart showing event counts by year.
  - Data derived from `receivedate` field, grouped by year.
  - Implemented using Chart.js.
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Chart renders with correct yearly data after search.
  - Updates with filter changes.

### 3.2 Non-Functional Requirements
#### NFR1: Performance
- **Description**: App should respond quickly within the 1-hour demo context.
- **Details**: Limit API results to 100 (`limit=100`) to ensure fast load times.
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Page loads and updates within 2 seconds on a standard connection.

#### NFR2: Usability
- **Description**: UI should be intuitive for basic interaction.
- **Details**: Use Tailwind CSS for a clean, functional layout.
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Users can search and filter without instructions.

#### NFR3: Technology
- **Description**: Built with Next.js and OpenFDA API.
- **Details**: Leverage Server Components and route handlers for efficiency.
- **Acceptance Criteria**: App runs locally with `npm run dev` and uses specified tech stack.

## 4. User Interface
### Layout
- **Header**: Title "Adverse Event Analyzer".
- **Search Section**: Text input + "Search" button.
- **Filter Section**: Dropdown for seriousness.
- **Results Section**: 
  - Metrics (e.g., "Total Reports: X | Deaths: Y | Hospitalizations: Z").
  - Bar chart showing events per year.

## 5. Dependencies
- **Next.js**: Framework for app structure and routing.
- **OpenFDA Adverse Events API**: Data source (`https://api.fda.gov/drug/event.json`).
- **Chart.js + react-chartjs-2**: Visualization library.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Styling framework.

## 6. Assumptions
- API is available and responsive during the 1-hour period.
- Drug names entered match API data (case-insensitive, exact match).
- No rate limiting or authentication issues with OpenFDA API.

## 7. Risks
- **Time Overrun**: Feature creep could exceed 1 hour.
  - Mitigation: Prioritize FR1-FR3; treat FR4 as bonus.
- **API Errors**: Invalid responses or downtime.
  - Mitigation: Add basic error handling (e.g., "No data found").

## 8. Success Criteria
- App launches and runs without errors.
- User can search for a drug (e.g., "DURAGESIC-100") and see results.
- Filter updates results, metrics reflect data, and chart (if completed) displays trends.
- Completed within 1 hour, demo-ready for interview.

## 9. Timeline
- **Total**: 1 hour (see Milestones doc for breakdown).
- **Deadline**: End of interview coding session.

## 10. Notes
- Focus on functionality over polish.
- Test with sample drugs: "DURAGESIC-100", "ASPIRIN".
- Keep code simple and readable for review.
